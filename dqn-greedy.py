#The Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm uses a greedy policy to select actions
#during training, typically an epsilon-greedy policy, where with probability
#ϵ, a random action is chosen (exploration), and with probability
#1−ϵ, the action with the highest predicted Q-value is selected
#(greedy exploitation). This balances exploration and exploitation.

#Here is a simple example Python code snippet demonstrating a
#DQN greedy policy during action selection in reinforcement learning

#This code models the epsilon-greedy policy used in DQN by choosing a
#random action with probability epsilon and the greedy
#(highest Q-value) action otherwise.
#The Q-network here is simplified as a random Q-value generator
#for demonstration. In practice, it is a neural network that
#estimates action-value functions based on the state input.

#This simple example captures the core idea of ​​using a greedy policy
#with epsilon exploration in DQN for reinforcement learning.
