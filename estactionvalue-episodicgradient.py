#Here is a simple Python example of episodic semi-gradient control in reinforcement learning, specifically
#semi-gradient SARSA with a linear function approximator for the action-value function. This example approximates the action-value function 
#q^(s,a,w)=wT x(s,a) where 
#w are the parameters and 
#x(s,a) is a feature vector for state-action pair.

#This example shows the core of episodic semi-gradient SARSA for control with linear function approximation.
#It uses epsilon-greedy policy to select actions and updates the weight vector 
#w by stochastic gradient descent on the TD error with respect to the parameterized action-value function.
#The feature vector is a simple one-hot concatenation here for demonstration; in practice, it would be designed based on the environment's state and action encoding.

#Let me know if the environment code or a more complex nonlinear approximation (e.g., neural networks) is needed.
#This code satisfies the requirements for approximating an action-value function with episodic semi-gradient control.
