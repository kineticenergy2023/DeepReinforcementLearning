#Here is a simple Python code example to compare the offline return (Monte Carlo style) with TD (Temporal-Difference) update for reinforcement learning value estimation.

#This example assumes a simple episodic environment with states and rewards.

#Offline return computes the return by looking at the whole reward sequence backward once after episode ends, updating values directly.

#TD update updates incrementally using the reward and estimated value of the immediate next state, using bootstrapping.

#This simple example shows the difference where offline uses the full return and TD uses a one-step estimate updated gradually by a learning rate

# Define a simple deterministic environment with 5 states and reward at the last state

# Number of states
n_states = len(rewards)

# Initialize value table for states for both methods
V_offline = np.zeros(n_states)
V_td = np.zeros(n_states)

# Generate a single episode trajectory (state and rewards)
episode = [(s, rewards[s]) for s in range(n_states)]

# Offline return (Monte Carlo) update

    G = reward + gamma * G

# TD update: update value estimate for each state based on reward and value estimate of next state

    state, reward = episode[i]
    next_state, _ = episode[i + 1]
    td_target = reward + gamma * V_td[next_state]
