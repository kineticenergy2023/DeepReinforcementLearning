#Here is a simple example code in Python illustrating how to approximate
#the action-value function with eligibility traces in reinforcement learning,
#using a linear function approximator

#This code uses a linear function approximator with one-hot state features and implements SARSA(λ) with
#accumulating eligibility traces to update weights representing the approximate action-value function.
#The eligibility traces help assign credit to recently visited state-action pairs proportionally to their
#trace values, decaying over time with λ and γ.

#This sample is minimal and illustrative, suitable for understanding and building upon eligibility traces
#with function approximation in RL. For practical purposes in more complex domains, feature representations,
#policies, and environment interactions would be more sophisticated
