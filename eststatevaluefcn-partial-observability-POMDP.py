#To address the request for simple code for approximating the state value function under partial observability in
#a Markov Decision Process (MDP) or Partially Observable MDP (POMDP) for reinforcement learning,
#I'll provide a concise Python example illustrating these concepts.

#The code will:

#Approximate a state value function 
#V(s) using a simple iterative method (value iteration) for a fully observable MDP.

#Incorporate partial observability by using a belief state (a probability distribution over states) to represent uncertainty.

#Use basic structures without dependencies on complex RL libraries, suitable for learning purposes.

#Here is a simple Python example:

#This example provides basic value iteration for an MDP and demonstrates how to evaluate a belief state value in a
#POMDP setting by taking the expectation of state values weighted by the belief distribution. This approach assumes
#the belief over states is known or estimated externally.

#If a more complex model with belief updates or learning in a POMDP is needed, that would involve additional
#mechanics like observation models and Bayesian updates of the belief state.

#This code aligns with common simple RL practices to learn the value function and partially handle partial observability via beliefs in a conceptual manner
