#The temporal difference (TD) method for reinforcement learning is a
#model-free approach that updates value estimates based on the
#difference between predictions at successive time steps,
#known as the TD error

#Below is a simple Python implementation of the core TD(0) update rule for estimating the value function 
#V(s)
# TD(0) value update for a single step

alpha = 0.1      # learning rate
gamma = 0.99     # discount factor

V = {}           # state-value estimates
states = ['A', 'B', 'C']    # example states
for s in states:
    V[s] = 0.0   # initialize values

# Simulate starting at state s, moving to s_next, and receiving reward r
s = 'A'
s_next = 'B'
r = 1.0

# TD(0) update
V[s] = V[s] + alpha * (r + gamma * V[s_next] - V[s])

#############################  EXPLANATION ###############

#V[s]: current estimate for state s

#r: reward for taking an action in state s

#V[s next]: value estimate for the next state

#γ: discount factor (how much to value future rewards)

#α: learning rate (how much to adjust value estimates per update)

#This rule updates the value function using the observed reward and the bootstrapped value estimate of the next state, capturing the essence of TD learning.

#How the TD Method Works
#Bootstrapping: TD methods update estimates based on other learned estimates, not just final outcomes like Monte Carlo methods.

#TD Error Calculation: The update is performed incrementally at each time step using the Bellman equation:

#V(s t)←V(s t)+α[R t+1+γV(s t+1)−V(s t)]
#where the term in brackets is the temporal difference error.

#Model-Free Learning: TD methods do not require a model of environment transitions, only observations of reward and state transitions.

#Typical Parameters
#Learning rate (α): Controls how much to adjust values per update.

#Discount factor (γ): Determines how much future rewards are valued compared to immediate rewards.

#The temporal difference approach, especially TD(0), forms the foundation of many RL algorithms like SARSA and Q-learning.
